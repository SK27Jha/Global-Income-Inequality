# 🌍 Global Income Inequality Dashboard

An interactive and data-driven dashboard that visualizes **global income inequality trends (2000–2023)** across 200+ countries.  
Developed using **Python, Streamlit, Power BI**, and **Pandas**, this project provides powerful insights into income distribution, Gini Index variations, and the socio-economic gap between nations.

> “Inequality is not just about income — it’s about opportunity. This dashboard aims to make those differences visible.”

## 🧭 Project Overview

The **Global Income Inequality Dashboard** aims to explore how income inequality has evolved over the past two decades.  
Using reliable global datasets, it presents **interactive visuals and analytics** that reveal the extent of income disparity among countries and regions.

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Even nations with high GDP show persistent inequality.
- The **top 10%** of earners capture nearly **40% of national income** worldwide.
- Inequality patterns between developing and developed countries remain surprisingly consistent.
- Visual trends highlight shifts in the **Gini Index**, income averages, and population growth over time.
